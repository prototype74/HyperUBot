# HyperUBot Guide - Set up in unsupported platforms

If you are reading this, probably you use an unconventional Operating System or Platform. Well, we will still try to help you, but offer no promise that it will work or will keep working in case we update it.

You must install the packages ``python3 git ffmpeg flac``, using your package manager. That you know better than us how to use. If not, uncle Google is your friend. Your platform also needs a way to perform pings via shell. In Debian based Linux distros, this is in a package named ``net-tools``.

It is also recommended, but not a requirement, to have the ``neofetch`` package installed.

In these platforms, we cannot help you much, as we lack knowledge.

You must also have Read and Write access to use the package manager, and a persistent storage. Platforms like Heroku will delete any extra content you place there, so the package manager will lose the package list.

## Full package list:

``python3 git ffmpeg flac neofetch`` 

Bash package that will contain ping.
